3. Grades Management System

The system stores the grades per subject and grade level of each student per periodic grading. The student's final grade for each subject will be automatically calculated and labeled the status if either the student passed or failed the subject.

The flow of this grading is; first, the system admin will create a new academic school year and select the current school year. Then, the system admin or staff user will populate the required list for making the student grades record, which is the list of the grade level, curriculum or program, subjects, and the student list. When adding a new student, the student's unique Learner Reference Number is required, and their details and the student's previous school attended records. The academic record feature in this system is where the system users store or manage the grades of a student per school year.
